% \chapter{Statistics of the Matter Density Field}
% From inflationary theories, the primorial curvature perturbation $\mathcal{R}$ i snear gaussian. Thus we need a statistical approach to density perturbations. As such, define the probability density functional
% \begin{equation}
% 	\mathcal{P}[\delta_1(x)] = \frac{1}{Z}\exp{\left[ -\frac{1}{2}\iint \delta_1(y) K(y,z) \delta_1(z) \right]}
% \end{equation}
% where $Z$ is the normalization constant, analogous to the partition function in field theory.

\chapter{IR Resummation}
In the previous chapter, we saw that the density in the Lagrangian picture is constant.
